        <article id="sec_main" class="sec_main">     
            <div class="left_div">
            <p>Although video game genres were once fairly clear cut, that’s simply not the case these days. There’s a growing variety of
                 genres and sub-genres to understand, especially as
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/game-developers-vs-game-publishers">game developers</a>
                    mix and blend different types of games in new and
                  unexpected ways.</p>

                  <p>
                    That means the video-gaming landscape is constantly evolving. Studios work on tight schedules and follow trends when
                      opportunity arises. We’re here to help you keep up. In our game genres list, we’ll cover 3 of the most relevant video game
                       categories today.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Open World</li>
                      <li>Shooter (FPS)</li>
                      <li>Survival and horror</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    Keep in mind that many genres have some degree of overlap with each other. Even in the early days of gaming,
                     terms like “action” and “fighting” could cover a lot of titles. That’s why many gamers prefer to use more specific names like those we’ll
                      cover in this article as a way to distinguish the style of gameplay.

            <h2>1.Sandbox (Open World)</h2>
            <p>
                The term “sandbox” may be more recognizable from its usage in tech or even as an open-ended mode available within certain games.
                 It’s often associated with player choice, open environments,and non-linear gameplay. The sandbox genre has grown from
                  a small niche to encompass a huge variety of titles.
            </p>
            <p>
                In these games, players often have less concrete goals and narrative pathways to pursue. Instead of beating the boss and 
                saving the princess, you may face a variety of tasks you can accomplish in a number of different ways. This draws players
                 into more immersive experiences, encouraging experimentation with what may be unfamiliar mechanics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sandbox titles can sometimes be highly conceptual and even lack some of the most recognizable gameplay elements. The 1984 game
                 Elite is a key example, with a simple design and play focused on combat, exploration, and trading. It also showcased an early
                  instance of procedural generation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simulation games like The Sims are also increasingly touted as sandbox titles, as are many popular franchises, including both 
                Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto. As game worlds expand and narratives diversify, expect more of an overlap with other gaming 
                genres.

            <h2>3.Shooter (FPS and TPS)</h2>
            <p>
                The shooter is another long-standing genre that developed several early offshoots and branched out into
                 two primary sub-genres: the first-person shooter (FPS) and third-person shooter (TPS).
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s plenty of potential for overlap here, too, since many contemporary titles allow you to toggle between first and third-person 
                viewpoints. Not only that, but most battle royale games
                 – a sub-genre unto itself – operate as either first or third-person shooters, including Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key difference is perspective. An FPS simulates a typical human viewpoint, showing essentially what your in-game character sees in franchises like Half-Life,
                 Call of Duty, and DOOM. A TPS pulls the perspective back
                 and showcases your entire character and surrounding environment, such as in the Gears of War and Tom Clancy’s The Division series.
            </p>

            <p>
                The premise for these games is simple, but it’s been repackaged in many ways over the years. Older players probably remember
                 the earliest arcade and gallery-style shooters with on-the-rails gameplay and relatively simple environments. Then there are 
                 shoot-em-ups (or shmups) and bullet-hell games, both of which rely heavily on twitchy gameplay involving plenty of shooting.
            </p>
            <p>
                While most shooter games split into FPS and TPS gameplay, they’re frequently talked about as elements in other games. 
                Grand Theft Auto V is an example of overlap. It rides the new wave of modern sandbox games, but it also has substantial
                 TPS elements (and you can play it in first-person if you want). By contrast, the Halo series is primarily known for its 
                 groundbreaking FPS gameplay.
            </p>

            <h2>9.Survival and horror</h2>
            <p>
                Survival and horror games have a lot of overlap, to the point that they even created their own sub-genre (survival horror).
                 In particular, horror games often share some basic features with their survival counterparts, though the reverse is less
                  often true. As developers add more FPS and conventional shooter features to certain horror and survival titles, there’s
                   even ongoing debate about how to define these games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core mechanics of a survival game centers on resource management, often incorporating crafting or salvage systems 
                that you can use to help keep your character alive. Minecraft is a popular standout, as is Don’t Starve. And then there 
                are games like The Long Dark, which focuses entirely on survival elements with a dedicated mode that increases difficulty.
            </p>

           <p>
            Horror is an even broader category, arguably encompassing dozens of survival titles. Almost anything with zombies, a post-apocalyptic
             storyline, or loads of jump scares is considered horror. These titles are often psychological, too, and use tension to immerse the
              player in the game. On the pure horror side, you have games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Alien: Isolation, and Blair Witch. 
              However, the most popular horror titles tend to fall into the survival-horror side of things, such as the Resident Evil and Evil
               Within franchises.
           </p>
